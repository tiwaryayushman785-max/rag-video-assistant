You're looking for an introduction to data science in our course. I found it in Video 1, where we start with the basics of what is data science.

The introduction begins at timestamp 69.6 seconds and ends at 75.0 seconds. In this video, you'll learn about the "roadmap" or "how to become a data scientist". 

If you want to dive into it, here's the link to Video 1: https://example.com/video1
